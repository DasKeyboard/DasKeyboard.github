## Sending Signals to your 5Q keyboard
A bit of lingo first: a *signal* is a message that contains color information (and more) to be
displayed on a 5Q keyboard. All 3rd party platforms communicate with the 5Q clients by sending 
 signals very much like your friends send text messages to your phone. Instead of being a text message, a 
 signal contains also key color information.

Even without a real 5Q keyboard, you can play with Signals. 
Signals will be display on the Q desktop "dashboard mode" and the Q Android app. 

There are several possibilities to send signals to the 5Q keyboard:
 
 - Zapier (https://zapier.com): use Zapier clould platform to create zaps (like IFTTT recipes). 
 Select the Action called "Das Keyboard Q". Zapier will create signals based on triggers such as
  emails, Facebook events, even new Youtube videos and much more. The app is currently working with invitations only, here is the link to access it: https://zapier.com/developer/invite/52454/1adf69b9a21dcfa16a1953d99baf253e/. 
 - API: see documentation at https://github.com/DasKeyboard/q/blob/master/q-api-doc.md.
