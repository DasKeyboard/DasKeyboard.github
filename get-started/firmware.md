(*) Mac and Linux firmware updaters are not available at this point. Please use a Windows PC 
to upgrade the device firmware. We know it's a major pain and we are working on it.

## Instructions for Windows

- Download the firmware file. If the 5Q firmware is up to date, the installer will not perform
    the upgrade. The current 5Q firmware version is displayed on the home page of the Q Desktop
    software. It is also displayed when running the firmware upgrade application
- <span style="color:red;">IMPORTANT:</span> Quit the Das Keyboard Q Software. 
Quit it by clicking on the `cog` icon on the top right corner of the application, 
and select `quit` on the dropdown menu
- Double click the firmware file to “Run” it. Windows 10 Defender may display a message regarding
 an "unrecognized app" that has been prevented from starting. You will
  need to run it in order to upgrade the firmware on the 5Q. To enable the firmware upgrade to proceed, 
click on `More Info` and follow the prompts to run the upgrader and update the firmware
- Don't forget to start the Das Keyboard Q software again

## Switching to Mac layout

To map the 5Q Windows key to Mac configuration see [knowledge base article](https://daskeyboard.mojohelpdesk.com/help/article/199507).

## Built-in Color Profiles

Preconfigured color profiles are embedded in some devices. Press `FN` + `1`-`6` on the NUMPAD to cycle through them. - [More info](https://daskeyboard.mojohelpdesk.com/help/article/199506)
