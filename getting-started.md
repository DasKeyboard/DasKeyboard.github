# Getting Started With Das Keyboard Q Software - beta

*Warning:* the Q software is in very early stage. It's buggy, incomplete, poorly document
and below all expectations, that means it is a start and it's improving fast. Only use it if you are 
conformtable being a beta tester and contributing useful feedback.

## Installation
### Download and install Q clients
Q clients can be downloaded from the Q website:
  http://q.daskeyboard.com/

Q clients are available for different platform:
 - Q Desktop: Windows, Linux, Mac coming soon.
 - Q Mobile: Android
 
### Create a Das Keyboard Q account
In order to use the Q clients, you'll need to create an account at
 http://q.daskeyboard.com/ 

### Sending Signals to your 5Q keyboard
A bit of lingo first: a signal is a message that contains color information (and more) to be
displayed on a 5Q keyboard. All 3rd party platforms communicates to the 5Q clients by sending 
 signals very much like your friends send you text messages on your phone. 

Even without a real 5Q keyboard, you can play with Signals by creating, updating and deleting them. 
To do that, you have several possibilities:
 
 - Zapier (https://zapier.com): use the Action called "Q-App". You will be able to create
 Signals based on triggers such as mails, Facebook events or even new Youtube videos.
 
 - TODO local API: see documentation at https://github.com/DasKeyboard/q/blob/master/README.md.
 - TODO Q cloud API: see documentation at https://github.com/DasKeyboard/q/blob/master/README.md.

### TODO

# Known issues

- Q cloud server is slow, very slow. Of course, we are working on it.
- HTTPS is not implemented for the moment, but will be very soon.
- Some breaking changes will be made on the Signals API, so if something does not work anymore,
 make sure you are using the last version of the API
