#### Zone as a key code
A key code is an easy to read representation of a zone. It is used to create a signal that will target
a zone with `language` meaning.
Examples:

* KEY_W for the Weather
* KEY_B for a new email from the Boss

The physical zone of the signal will change depending on the layout ( KEY_Y is not at the same place
in a german and a US Layout)
